# Analyzing NFL Data in SQL
 In this project I use SQL to analyze data on NFL plays. I downloaded the dataset from Kaggle which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kendallgillies/nflstatistics). I first cleaned and formatted the data using the Pandas library in Python. I was primarily focused on what factors contributed to a team either running or passing the ball, so I removed many unnecessary columns, leaving only 9 that I thought were relevant. I also filtered the data to only pass and run plays, leaving out other play types like kickoffs and field goals. Finally, I changed the "play_type" column to be a "1" for pass plays and a "0" for run plays.
